# RSA-Encryption-Python
Program that encrypts and decrypts user input using RSA.

### RSA_Keygen
Calculates the private and public key by searching for the smallest value of e (part of public key) and uses the extended Euclidean method to calculate d (private key).

### RSA_Encryption
Takes in a method and a key to encrypt or decrypt the message.

### EncryptionTest
Takes two primes from the user and a message and encrypts the message and then decrypts it.
